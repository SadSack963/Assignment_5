Tkinter Events
==============
Extract from tkinter source code.
Also see https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/bind.html#M6

SEQUENCE is a string of concatenated event patterns. An event pattern is of the form
  <MODIFIER-MODIFIER-TYPE-DETAIL> where
MODIFIER is one of
  Control,
  Mod2,
  M2,
  Shift,
  Mod3,
  M3,
  Lock,
  Mod4,
  M4,
  Button1,
  B1,
  Mod5,
  M5,
  Button2,
  B2,
  Meta,
  M,
  Button3,
  B3,
  Alt,
  Button4,
  B4,
  Double,
  Button5,
  B5,
  Triple,
  Mod1,
  M1.
TYPE is one of
  Activate,
  Enter,
  Map,
  ButtonPress,
  Button,
  Expose,
  Motion,
  ButtonRelease,
  FocusIn,
  MouseWheel,
  Circulate,
  FocusOut,
  Property,
  Colormap,
  Gravity Reparent,
  Configure,
  KeyPress,
  Key,
  Unmap,
  Deactivate,
  KeyRelease,
  Visibility,
  Destroy,
  Leave.
DETAIL is
  the button number for ButtonPress and ButtonRelease
  the Keysym for KeyPress and KeyRelease.
Examples are
  <Control-Button-1> for pressing Control and mouse button 1
  <Alt-A> for pressing A and the Alt key (KeyPress can be omitted)
  <B1-Motion> for mouse movement with the left button clicked.
  <Alt-B1-Motion> for mouse movement with the left button clicked and the Alt key pressed.
  <Control-comma> is equivalent to <Control-KeyPress-comma>
An event pattern can also be a virtual event of the form
  <<AString>> where AString can be arbitrary.
  This event can be generated by event_generate.
If events are concatenated they must appear shortly after each other.
